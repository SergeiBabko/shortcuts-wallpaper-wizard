‼️     ATTENTION     ‼️

Be aware that you need to create «Wallpapers» album manually before using this shortcut. Otherwise, Recents album will be used.
Also, don’t forget to set your beloved Wallpapers album in next places:

Get random photo depends on connection: Photos

⬇️     User Authentication     ⬇️

To authenticate requests to the Unsplash API, enter your application's access key in the provided text field. Otherwise, the outdated Unsplash Sources API will be used.

##################################################


⬇️     Unsplash Image Chances     ⬇️

With the chance parameters, you're in full control of the wallpaper you see. Choose a 100% chance for a fresh Unsplash photo every time, or set it lower to mix it up with your own favorite Wallpapers.


##################################################


⬇️     Possibility To Save Or Share Wallpaper     ⬇️

Whether you want to save new Wallpaper or not, it's up to you! Simply type «auto», «show» or leave it empty to enable or disable saving options.


##################################################


⬇️     Unsplash Search Parameters     ⬇️

Customize your search results with your preferred parameters. You can use as many words as you like for each parameter, but make sure there's at least one word to get the results you want. Otherwise, the Shortcut will choose a random image for you.

To enable the use of these search parameters, set the [useSearch] in Initial Search Parameters to «true». You can also select whether to perform a random search or the first one on the list by setting the [randomSearch] in Initial Search Parameters to «true» or «false».

Keep in mind that in order to use search parameters, the use of topics must be disabled, which can be achieved by setting the [useTopics] in Initial Search Parameters to «false».

Examples:
    • space
    • cat in hat
    • sea, beach, yacht


##################################################


⬇️     Unsplash Topics     ⬇️

The Unsplash API provides a list of predefined topics for you to choose from, so there's no need to add new ones. Custom topics will be ignored, I promise :)

To enable the use of these topics, set the [useTopics] in Initial Search Parameters to «true». You can also select whether to use a random topic or the first one on the list by setting the [randomTopic] in Initial Search Parameters to «true» or «false».

Here’s the list of default topics:
wallpapers
renders
travel
nature
street photography
experimental
textures & patterns
animals
architecture & interior
fashion & beauty
film
food & drink
people
spirituality
business & work
